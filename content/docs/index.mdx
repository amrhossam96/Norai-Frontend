# Norai API Overview

The Norai API provides developers with powerful tools to track user behavior, analyze patterns, and generate intelligent recommendations. Our API is designed with RESTful principles and supports secure authentication methods to integrate seamlessly with your applications.

## Key Features

- **User Identification**: Link anonymous users to identified accounts with unified profiles
- **ML-Powered Recommendations**: Generate personalized recommendations based on user behavior
- **User Segmentation**: Automatically segment users based on behavior patterns
- **Real-Time Analytics**: View comprehensive dashboards and insights
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Built to handle millions of events with sub-100ms response times
