# Event Tracking

Track user events and interactions to build a comprehensive understanding of user behavior. Norai's event tracking is simple to integrate and powerful enough to capture any user action.

## iOS SDK (Available Now)

The easiest way to track events is using our iOS SDK:

```swift
import Norai

// Track a simple event
Norai.shared.trackEvent(
    name: "product_tapped",
    properties: [
        "product_id": "prod_123",
        "category": "electronics",
        "price": 299.99
    ]
)

// Track with entity information
Norai.shared.trackEvent(
    name: "product_viewed",
    properties: [
        "entity": [
            "external_id": "prod_456",
            "category": "fashion",
            "price": 99.99
        ],
        "screen": "product_detail",
        "source": "search"
    ]
)
```

## Android & React Native (Coming Soon)

Android (Kotlin/Java) and React Native SDKs are currently in development. Check back soon for updates.

## Direct API Integration

You can also track events directly via our API if you're not using the SDK:

<ApiBlock
  method="POST"
  endpoint="/v1/events"
  curl={`curl -X POST "https://api.norai.com/v1/events" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "external_user_id": "user_123",
    "event_name": "product_purchased",
    "properties": {
      "product_id": "prod_789",
      "category": "electronics",
      "price": 499.99,
      "quantity": 1
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-12-03T10:30:00Z"
  }'`}
  nodejs={`const response = await fetch('https://api.norai.com/v1/events', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    project_id: 'your-project-id',
    external_user_id: 'user_123',
    event_name: 'product_purchased',
    properties: {
      product_id: 'prod_789',
      category: 'electronics',
      price: 499.99,
      quantity: 1
    },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
});

const data = await response.json();`}
  python={`import requests
from datetime import datetime

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.norai.com/v1/events",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "project_id": "your-project-id",
        "external_user_id": "user_123",
        "event_name": "product_purchased",
        "properties": {
            "product_id": "prod_789",
            "category": "electronics",
            "price": 499.99,
            "quantity": 1
        },
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
    }
)

data = response.json()`}
/>

## Event Properties

Events can include any custom properties relevant to your application:

### Common Event Types

- `product_viewed` - User viewed a product
- `product_tapped` - User tapped/clicked a product
- `add_to_cart` - User added item to cart
- `purchase_completed` - User completed a purchase
- `screen_viewed` - User viewed a screen
- `button_clicked` - User clicked a button
- `search_performed` - User performed a search

### Property Guidelines

- Use snake_case for property names
- Include entity information when relevant (product_id, content_id, etc.)
- Add contextual data (category, price, source, etc.)
- Keep property values simple (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Use consistent naming across your app

## Batch Event Tracking

For high-volume applications, you can send events in batches:

<ApiBlock
  method="POST"
  endpoint="/v1/events/batch"
  curl={`curl -X POST "https://api.norai.com/v1/events/batch" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "events": [
      {
        "external_user_id": "user_123",
        "event_name": "product_viewed",
        "properties": {"product_id": "prod_1"},
        "timestamp": "2025-12-03T10:30:00Z"
      },
      {
        "external_user_id": "user_456",
        "event_name": "product_viewed",
        "properties": {"product_id": "prod_2"},
        "timestamp": "2025-12-03T10:31:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }'`}
/>

## Best Practices

1. **Track consistently**: Use the same event names across your application
2. **Include context**: Add relevant properties to each event
3. **Use entities**: Link events to products, content, or other entities
4. **Timestamp accuracy**: Include accurate timestamps for historical data
5. **Identify users**: Call `identify()` when users log in to link anonymous sessions
