## Common Issues

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Invalid API key error

**Solution**:
1. Check that your API key is correct and hasn't expired
2. Ensure you're using the correct format: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
3. Verify the API key has the necessary permissions
4. Generate a new key if needed from your developer account

### Rate Limiting

**Problem**: 429 Too Many Requests error

**Solution**:
1. Check your current rate limits in your developer account
2. Implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. Use batch endpoints to reduce API calls
4. Cache recommendations when possible
5. Consider upgrading your account tier

### SDK Integration

**Problem**: SDK not tracking events

**Solution**:
1. Verify SDK is properly configured with API key and project ID
2. Check that you have network connectivity
3. Enable debug logging to see what's being sent
4. Ensure events are formatted correctly
5. Check for any console errors

### Missing Recommendations

**Problem**: Recommendations API returning empty results

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you have tracked enough events (minimum 100 events per user)
2. Verify the user ID exists in your project
3. Check if the user has any recent activity
4. Try requesting more recommendations (higher limit)
5. Use fallback logic to show popular items

## Report a Bug
